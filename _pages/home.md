Welcome to my personal website. I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in Biomedical Engineering at Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, specializing in biomedical signal processing (ECG, vesical pressure), cardiac modeling, and AI-driven (Machine and deep learning) healthcare technologies.  

With dual PhDs in Biomedical Engineering and Applied Mathematics, I develop Computational diagnostic tools, computational cardiac models, and biomedical data science solutions. I am passionate about translating research into need-driven healthcare innovations, securing competitive grants, mentoring students, and advancing high-impact biomedical science.
