## Current & Recent Research Projects

- **Estimation of Urological Events from Single-Channel Vesical Pressure Signals** *(Ongoing)*  
  Developing **AI and deep learning algorithms** to detect clinically relevant urological events (abdominal, detrusor, and void) for improved diagnostics and patient management.

- **Assessment of a Wireless Ambulatory Urodynamics Device**  
  Validating an **FDA-approved wireless device** in women with **neurogenic bladder** and men with **voiding dysfunction** to improve real-world clinical assessment.

- **Estimation of Serum Potassium and Calcium in CKD Patients from ECG**  
  Developed **novel ECG biomarkers and algorithms** for timely detection of electrolyte imbalances in **chronic kidney disease** patients.

- **Assessing Inter-Patient Variability in ECG Response**  
  Built **computational models** to explain variability in ECG biomarkers under changing **electrolyte conditions**.

- **Cardiac Arrhythmia Prediction**  
  Designed and trained **neural network models** using **heart rate variability** data to predict life-threatening arrhythmias.
